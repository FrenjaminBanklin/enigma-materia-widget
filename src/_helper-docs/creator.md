#### Answers ####

Each question can have many possible answers, but every question must have at least one correct answer with a value of 100%.

If the **Randomize Answer Order** check box in the main screen is checked, then the order of all questions' answers will be randomized each time a student plays the widget.

	Keep in mind that <strong>Randomize Answer Order</strong> will not affect the order of the questions, only the answers for each question.
