#### Answers ####

Questions must have at least one 100% correct answer, but may have more than one answer choice marked correct. In addition, you can use the **Set percentage** option to assign a percentage score value for the corresponding answer choice.

If the **Randomize Answer Order** check box in the main screen is toggled on, then the order of answer choices within each question will be randomized every time a student plays this widget.

	Keep in mind that <strong>Randomize Answer Order</strong> will not affect the order of the questions within a category, only the answers for each question.

#### Hide Correct Answers ####

If this option is selected, the correct answer will not be provided on the score screen once a student completes the widget. By default, the score screen will display which answers were incorrect, along with the correct value for each question.

#### Feedback ####

Feedback is purely optional, but may be used to provide helpful information for incorrect answers or additional details for correct answers.
